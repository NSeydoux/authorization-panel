## Minutes

## Introducing Nick Mondada

NM: I'm working on Inrupt and has been following AuthZ work. I plan to participate in meetings and contribute to this development.

## Imports Proposal

Discussion with screen sharing of
[issue 210](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/210).

Elf and Justin: notes on the problem of OWL   complexity and learning curve.
Henry: There may be ways to build user-friendly OWL constructs. We need to find out. See [question to mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2021May/0007.html)
    I prefer to start from a good formal system which I know to have been very well studied and then move to making it align with intuitions of security developers. 
    
Justin: the inheritance part of ACP has not been worked out fully yet.    
Elf: It would be good to compare how ACP and `:imports`  can resolve the same problem.


Justin: here are some ideas on use cases one could try comparing answers to.

* https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/#inheritance-manage
* https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/#inheritance-adding
* https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/#inheritance-modifying
* https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/#inheritance-forcing
* https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/#conditional-time

Henry: I need to get my third milestone in very soon, but I am happy to try to see if I can implement a few of these.
   It would be very helpful if someone who really understands ACP (Matthieu perhaps) shows how ACP is thinking of doing it.


## Actions

* Henry to try to show how a few examples work
* Matthieu and Justin and Henry to discuss which are the best use cases to look at first.
