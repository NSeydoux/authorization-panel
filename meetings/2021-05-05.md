from previous meeting commited

### Issue 206 [Scalability of writing ACP to every resource](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/206)

KK: If you write something to ACR you need to make sure that you don't ..... before you propagate it.
KK: ...

JB: Ultimately one needs to pay the cost somewhere. Do we want to pay it when you make the change or on each request.

MB: ACP is pretty unspecific at this moment as to how this is done. 

KK: I don't see how one could address problem of traversing prefix tree.
Eric: Implementation can choose how to optimize things. For example server can mark resource as dirty and write ACR when it's needed.

Pavlik: As long as we have clear source of truth and we will not write some rules that get overwritten when inherited rules are applied, implementation should be able to optimize in different ways.


### Issue 210:  [Add include/import relation](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/210)

HS: WAC `default` feels like a quick hack. It has problems with overwriting inherited rules etc. `:includes` means to include all the statements from included resource into current resource.

KK: In propagation one would need to invalidate cache as you go down the tree. Here it seems that one can use the cache.
