### Propose we discuss some issue prioritization

JB: There are 85 issues and it seems that some of them may not be relevant anymore. Most importantly we need to prioritize.

EP: Request that OP provides some criteria for how the issue can be resolved. Also provide some acceptance criteria into contributing. Possibly move some issues into github threaded discussions.

EP: Propose an issue template including acceptance criteria (propose switching to discussion if you can't think of the right criteria)

### ACP draft PR

JB: I'm working with Matthieu B on that proposal. We think that best way to get feedback is complete proposal and code showcasing it. We expect approximately 4-6 weeks from now to complete it (though next week hope to provide specific target dates, and those estimates could change)

## Actions

- Enable github discussions on Authorization Panel (JB - DONE)
- Create an issue template with acceptance criteria section (EP)
