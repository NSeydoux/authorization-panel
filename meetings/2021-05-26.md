# 2021-05-19 Solid Authorization

https://meet.jit.si/solid-authorization


## Agenda

* Minutes https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/214
* Use Case 1: Resource Access https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/215
* Use Case 3: Inheritance https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/216

### If time allows (from previous week)
* Inheritance with [Referenced Data Grants](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#datamodel-referenced-data-grant) (interop panel)
  * UC [Conditional access by relationship](https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/#conditional-relationship)
  * Can we 'search and replace' `Report` -> `Project` and `Measurement` -> `Task`? This will align it with scenario used in interop spec, primer, and shape trees spec


## Present

* E Pavlik
* Henry Story
* Matthieu B
* Justin B


## Minutes

Elf: Could we show best practice of how the statements are divided between resources?

Justin: There are a number of use cases that rely on creating and deleting things. Are we satisfied with the notion of using WAC modes across the board, and if so, are they sufficient to satisfy the use cases that we have? (Deletion/Creation)

Matthieu: The idea is to use ACL modes and add new ones as needed.

Justin: ACL modes as they stand might be insufficient for some use cases. Probably we could address the use cases and flag where the deficiency shows.

Henry: We can try to see if it works with what we have and if not we can see if we need a new mode.

Elf: How is deleting an ACR supposed to work?

Matthieu: A control resource can not be deleted since it is server managed. Only when the resource itself is deleted does the control goes.

Henry: In [PR 215](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/215) ACP examples, it might help to have the relative URLs linking to the resources. I find it makes things clearr.

Elf: :-1: to relative :thumbsup: CURIEs. We could also just use TRIG and have the graph name standing for resource name. It is confusing to the point that you'd think you can change what is the ACR of the resource 1.

Elf: created issue regarding permission on Access Policy Resources https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/217

### Inheritance

Now looking at [PR 216](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/216).

Henry: This is the important use case, as it pretty much appears immediately when adding access control to a web server.
(I know as I am doing that right now in [Reactive Solid](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD)).
When starting a fresh webserver, it has to contain an original access control rule to edit the root resource.
Then, when creating a new resource or container, that needs to inherit the access control rules from the initial ones, or else it would have none and so not be accessible.
Furthermore the client adding content needs to be able to find the ACR.

The difference between ACP and WAC is that ACP allows you to put the rules in a different document from the access control resource.
Another is that wac tries to solve inheritance with wac:default. 
But this is problematic: it has the effect of leading there to be only one acl resource per server. 
This in turn explains why there is such a strong reaction against making the acl content visible: one has to make everything or nothing visible. 
Why does acl:default feel like it was designed for implementations happy with the archictectural decision of having one unique acl document per web server? 
Well if you do create an ACR for a resource, you immediately loose all content of the linked to acl:default, meaning the content has to be copied over to the new acl, leading to duplication and so potentially to errors because [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)). 
This is what [issue 210: add :imports relation](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/210) aims to address.

Justin: I think that ACP to WAC comparison even with questions as to how you map resources to statements, it doesn't seem like it's apples to apples to not include resources. You need both to look at the difference. Probably we could help answer some of those questions through this exercise. If you divide it up in one way it might be problematic.

Henry: The main advantage of ACP is that you can put rules in different documents.

### PR215

Pavlik: I would find it helpful to see which statements are made in which resource. As well as how we manage access to all the resources including policies and rules.

## Actions

* Matthieu to show how statements are divided amongst resources
